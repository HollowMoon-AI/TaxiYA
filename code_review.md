# Code Review Guidelines

The purpose of a code review is to ensure that all code in our codebase is of the highest quality. This document outlines the steps and guidelines for conducting a code review.

## Check for Syntax Errors

Ensure that the code is syntactically correct and does not contain any obvious errors. This includes checking for missing semicolons, incorrect indentation, undeclared variables, etc.

## Check for Logical Errors

Review the logic of the code to ensure that it behaves as expected. This includes checking for incorrect loop conditions, incorrect if-else conditions, etc.

## Check for Code Style

Ensure that the code follows the agreed-upon style guide. This includes checking for adherence to naming conventions, use of white space, etc.

## Check for Code Efficiency

Review the code for any potential performance issues. This includes checking for unnecessary loops, redundant code, etc.

## Check for Code Readability

Ensure that the code is easy to read and understand. This includes checking for clear variable names, short and concise functions, etc.

## Check for Code Documentation

Ensure that the code is well-documented, with clear comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section of code.

For more context on the codebase, please refer to the [README.md](README.md) file.
